## Features
### Potential Features To Include:
- Providing information on latest sale, releases and trending products

- Provide information and contact information where to find or contact our company
- Show a fictional preview and promote the company's mobile app
- Navigation Bar to access other pages
### Suggested Javascript Features To Include:
- Micro interactions when interacting with the site eg, clicking on an interactable area to show some animation, mouse over interactions, scrolling interactions when interacting with the site.
- A product category filter box which allows users to filter products
- Add to cart function
## Design Rationale
I chose this design for its sleek, minimalistic, and modern aesthetic, inspired by the approach of leading brands like Nike and Adidas. The layout features a promotion bar and a showcase poster to highlight available offers, capturing users' attention immediately. I selected Arial and Futura fonts, commonly used by Nike, to achieve a clean and streamlined look. The design promotes the websiteâ€™s mobile app, providing customers with a more convenient shopping experience, while the filter function enhances user navigation, helping them find their ideal shoes easily. As an e-commerce website, I included an "Add to Cart" feature for seamless shopping, and an About page offers users more insight into the company. To maintain a minimalistic vibe, I kept animations to a minimum, ensuring the focus remains on the products themselves.
